Contributions also welcome.\r\n\r\n*Pro-tip: Digitizing archival photos is super fast if you're able to invest in a Fujitsu SnapScan scanner that scans roughly 30 images a minute*\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## How-to\r\n* **Easy way**: Simply clone this repo, cut and paste the source code of 'index.html' into your own Tumblr blog and make sure you point all the scripts/dependencies to your server's instance.\r\n\r\n* **Hard way**: Install the free Tumblr framework [The Minimalist](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/12051), then manually insert the code snippets from 'index.html', 'styles.css' and 'SMNmediavaultscript.js' into the theme, along with all scripts/stylesheets. \r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Author: [Carl V.
