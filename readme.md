## Use-case

The Digital Team at *Savannah Morning News* chose Tumblr as the platform of choice to share pictures of Savannah yesteryear from its archives -– primarily because of Tumblr's ease of use for older staffers as well as the ability to paginate out each post and drive clickthroughs. 

Feel free to [fork this project on Github](http://github, especially if you're a media organization seeking to gain new value from idle stacks of newspapers. Contributions also welcome.

## How-to
* **Easy way**: Simply clone this repo, cut and paste the source code of 'index.html' into your own Tumblr blog and make sure you point all the scripts/dependencies to your server's instance.

* **Hard way**: Install the free Tumblr framework [The Minimalist](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/12051), then manually insert the code snippets from 'index.html', 'styles.css' and 'SMNmediavaultscript.js' into the theme, along with all scripts/stylesheets.
